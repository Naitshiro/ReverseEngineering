# Reverse Engineering

## What's that repo for???
This repository serves as a record of my progress and projects in reverse engineering, where I document my learning journey and share my experiences. My personal goal is to learn the basics of reverse engineering and improve my skills overtime.

## Discalimer
As you may expect, in this repository you WILL find actual malwares. If you want to reverse engineer those files yourself, you're free to do that, but **I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you to do so in an isolated VM, without networking, and without any of your data inside**. It's crucial to take all the necessary precautions.

Shouldn't say that, but **DON'T FUCK ARROUND WITH MALWARES IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING... I AM NOT, AND WILL NEVER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU MAY CAUSE ON YOUR SYSTEM, OR OTHERS'.**

Also, do note that I'm no such "professional reverse engineer", I'm just a student which is learning reverse engineering basics. Take my findings with a grain of salt, as some of my code may be wrongly interpreted.
